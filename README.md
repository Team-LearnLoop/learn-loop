# Auth React Starter

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org)
- [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io)

## Create Database and Table

Create a new database called `` and create a `user` table:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE "user" (
    "id" SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    "username" VARCHAR (80) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    "password" VARCHAR (1000) NOT NULL
);
```

Go to the `database.sql` file and copy and paste everything into SQL

If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change `auth_react_starter` to the name of your new database name in `server/modules/pool.js`.

## Development Setup Instructions

- Run `npm install`.
    - Be sure to take stock of `package.json` to see which dependencies you'll need to add.
- Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:

```plaintext
SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret
```

While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [Password Generator Plus](https://passwordsgenerator.net). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.

- Start postgres if not running already by using opening up the [Postgres.app](https://postgresapp.com), or if using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) you can use the command `brew services start postgresql`.
- Run `npm run server` to start the server.
- Run `npm run client` to start the client.
- Navigate to `localhost:5173`.
